# Employee's data analysis

The main goal of this project is to get to know about Postgresql, to create and managade databases, to understand queries, specially keys and joins. 

This code creates and analyzes the database of the employees of a company. EmployeeSQL.sql imports and creates the tables for each of the CSV files. EmployeeTableQueries.sql executes queries and creates tables with all the information gathered. The information ranges from finding the details of every employee, to finding the frequency of each employee's last name. A schematic is included to visualize the database.
